This project aims to propose a GA-based task scheduling algorithm for cloud computing in the CloudSim simulation environment. The proposed algorithm considers various parameters, including task 
computation time, task deadline, and resource availability, to optimize the allocation of tasks to virtual machines. The algorithm's performance is evaluated by comparing it with other scheduling 
algorithms in terms of makespan, utilization, and energy consumption.
